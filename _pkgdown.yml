  - title: R package overview
    desc: The functions of the spacemap R package are perhaps best conceptualized in three categories. The model fitting category concerns functions that learns a network from input data for a given set of parameters. The model selection category encompasses functions that select the optimal parameters of spacemap for a specific dataset. The last category is network analysis, which contains tools to annotate and interpret model output.
