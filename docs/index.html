<p>This software enables network learning from heterogenous data types in a high-dimensional context by applying a novel conditional graphical model called spaceMap. The model is motivated by applications in integrative genomics, where two (or more) omic data profiles are modeled jointly to discover their interactions. The penalized multivariate regression framework of spaceMap partitions the high-dimensional omic variables into responses and predictors; then the model learns two types of general interactions (or edges) to form the network. It learns a directed network of predictor-&gt;response interactions, which are known to act as perturbations to an undirected network of response–response interactions that is simultaneously learned by the model. Such interactions are learned by conditioning each response variable on predictors and all other responses. This regression framework is sufficiently general to learn networks in diverse applications that exhibit hub topology. Below, we illustrate the need for such models through a specific application to breast cancer tumor data. Further details of the model and this specific application will be forthcoming (contingent upon acceptance) in the proceedings of an upcoming conference. This software’s documentation and illustration of the breast cancer network analysis is forthcoming. We welcome your feedback and participation.</p>

<p>The developmental version of <code>spacemap</code> is available from GitHub. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/topherconley/spacemap/releases/tag/v0.45.0-beta">most recent beta release</a> for installation.</p>

<div id="learning-robust-networks" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#learning-robust-networks" class="anchor"> </a>Learning robust networks</h2>
<p>We built model selection and model aggregation tools into spaceMap for learning networks robust to the challenges of integrative genomics data. High dimensional omic profiles often have limitations in sample size and the signal-to-noise can be low. Models applied to data in this context can be prone to overfitting and high variability. By virtue of a K-fold cross validation (CV) procedure called <em>CV.Vote</em>, one can learn model tuning parameters that will help balance the tradeoff of power and FDR. <em>CV.Vote</em> reports a network where edges must be present in a majority of networks fit under the training sets. Please see <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/articles/tune_sim1.html">Model Tuning</a> section (see also navigation bar) for an example of how to sequentially tune your network with cross validation. Specific usage details of <em>CV.Vote</em> are documented in the function <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/crossValidation.html">crossValidation</a>.</p>
<p>Making your network robust to overfitting can be further enhanced through bootstrap aggregation—called <em>Boot.Vote</em>—especially when sample size relative to dimension is a real concern. This procedure learns networks on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> bootstrap replications of data under CV-selected tuning parameters. The bootstrap replicate networks are aggregated such that only those edges with majority representation among the replicates are reported in the final network. Specific usage details and an example of <em>Boot.Vote</em> are documented in the function <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/reprodEdge.html">reprodEdge</a>.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#network-analysis-toolkit" class="anchor"> </a>Network analysis toolkit</h2>
<p>Once a network has been learned, interpretation can prove quite challenging without a proper set of tools. We included a network analysis toolkit (see here for documentation) as part of the spaceMap package to facilitate network interpretation with special interest in integrative genomic applications. Our toolkit enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>annotation of nodes (e.g. gene coordinates, functional description)</li>
<li>identification of cis/trans regulatory information</li>
<li>prioritization of hub nodes</li>
<li>module analysis (community detection)</li>
<li>pathway enrichment analysis (GO/KEGG)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features of the network analysis are reported through structured tables and are easily incorporated into technical manuscripts in a variety of formats. Perhaps more importantly, the network analysis integrates the results into a network file that can be exported (e.g. <code>.graphml</code> format) to existing tools such as the <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/what_is_cytoscape.html">Cytoscape ecosystem</a>. spaceMap is not just a model; rather it is a powerful tool for deriving meaning from integrative genomics data.</p>
<p>This toolkit is best illustrated on a network analysis of The Breast Cancer Proteogomics Landscape Study data, which is hosted on the GitHub repository <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/neta-bcpls/">neta-bcpls</a>. The documentation for this network analysis is in progress and will forthcoming. Please check back.</p>

<div id="simulations" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#simulations" class="anchor"> </a>Simulations</h2>
<p>Several simulation studies have evaluated spaceMap’s performance in learning networks that exhibit modular structure with prominent hub topology—a commonly encountered feature of biological networks. Detailed outcomes of those simulations are currently featured in the manuscript submitted to <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017">ISMB ECMB 2017</a>. The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/topherconley/sim-spacemap">sim-spacemap</a> contains code affiliated with those simulations featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>simulation of network topology</li>
<li>data generation according to the network topology</li>
<li>fitting of spaceMap and other graphical models to</li>
<li>evaluation of graphical model performance relative to truth</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation of these simulation codes will be forthcoming.</p>
